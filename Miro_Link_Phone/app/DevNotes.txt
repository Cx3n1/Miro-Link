Known bugs
#1: if ip and port is inputted so that they connect to something but not the server
    connection button changes to Waiting and gets disabled as usual but sometimes
    error message doesn't display and button doesn't return to enabled mode so
    user is forced to restart the app

    solution: idk (aka working progress) still unable to figure out why sometimes it works fine
    but sometimes not :p
